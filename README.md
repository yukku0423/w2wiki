### W2 by Steven Frank

#### A web-based, wiki-like notepad that you host yourself.

Notable features:

- Written in PHP for portability and hackability
- Uses Markdown syntax for formatting notes
- Fits to screen nicely when viewed on iPhone, with custom icon for adding to home screen
- Use double-brackets [[like this]] to link to another note by title
- Title & content search
- Filesystem storage (no database)
- Plaintext storage
- Image attachment uploading
- Public or password-protected
- Unlike cloud / hosted solutions, you retain control of your data
